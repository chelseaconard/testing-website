module SessionsHelper

    end
#The session method is defined by Rails and acts like a hash where we can store pertinent information such as the user.id. session places a temporary cookie on the userâ€™s browser with an encryption of the user.id. We can retrieve the user.id at anytime to ensure that the user is logged into the application. 

    def current_user
        @current_user ||= User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])
#this could also be written as: 
#@current_user = @current_user || User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])
#this means that if the @current_user is not nil, return it, otherwise, assign to it the User object with the specified id. 
    end

    def logged_in?
        !current_user.nil? #returns true if the user is logged in and false otherwise. This can of course be implemented differently.
    end

def  log_out
   session.delete(:user_id) 
   @current_user = nil
